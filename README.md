# Monitor Links

## Developed by

[Laisy C. F. S.](https://github.com/laisy)

## About the project

Monitor Links is an application that was conceived as a step in the selection process.

### Project features

It consists of a web application with 2 routes:
- /links
- /screenshots

In the links route it will be possible to register links to be "monitored", listed or removed.
Each URL registered will be a job to be executed in the worker every 1 minute. The worker needs to receive the URL, enter the page with a webdriver and print the home.
The /screenshots route will display the screenshots taken with date,
separated by link sorted by descending date.
Need:
- be versioned
- follow a code pattern
- Basic README with installation
Note:
- Use the technology you want and how you prefer
- selenium documentation: https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/
- test with Cat As A Service *_* cataas.com/cat
